## 🏗️ How It Works
The system contains:
- A **Rule** class (conditions + diagnosis)
- An **ExpertSystem** class (stores rules and matches symptoms)
- A simple **CLI interface** that collects symptoms from the user

When the user enters symptoms, the expert system:
1. Checks each rule  
2. Verifies if all conditions match  
3. Returns the diagnosis
